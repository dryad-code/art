`art`: an ASCII art creation tool
=================================
`art` is an ASCII art creation tool (as you can see from the above heading).  
Creating ASCII art in a text editor is pretty annoying (having to repeatedly type spaces and delete characters).  That's where `art` comes in.  In `art`, you can use the arrow keys to move to any place on the screen.  You then can save the resulting art in a file.  

To use it, type in the following command at a terminal:  
`art file_where_you_want_to_save_your_art`  
Then, use the arrow keys to navigate the screen, and type in whatever letters you need to create your art.  To save to the file, press the "s" key on your keyboard.  

To install `art`, first `cd` to the directory where you downloaded `art`.  Then, run the following commands __as root__:  
`chmod +x art`  
`mv art /usr/bin/art`  
Enjoy art!
